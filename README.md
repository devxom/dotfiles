# My dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## How it's work

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

## Install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/devxom/dotfiles.git dotfiles
cd dotfiles
```
## Theme

I like now https://github.com/catppuccin

## Thanks

There are a lot of dotfiles I've been inspired by. All were under open licences
 from MIT. I don't remember all of them, so I won't list them. If you think any
 of the solutions are similar to yours. I may well have adapted it, and I say thank you
